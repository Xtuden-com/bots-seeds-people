              Igor Strelkov is a self described Russian nationalist, and 
              former colonel in Russian military intelligence, who has 
              been charged by Ukranian authorities with terrorism.  He 
              is currently being sued by the families of 18 passengers 
              on the MH17 because forces under his command are allegedly 
              responsible for shooting it down.

            <p>
            I like this quote from Luciano Floridi who is at the Oxford Internet
            Institute because it speaks to the rate at which our ability to
            generate data is far outstripping our ability to store it. 
            </p>
            <p>
            According to IDCâ€™s projections, the size of global storage
            capacity relative to the amount of data generated is expected
            to decline by half by 2020 (from 33% to 15%). Efficient use of
            available space will, therefore, be crucial.
            </p>
            <p>
            David Rosenthal has predicted that by 2018 it will cost more than
            the total GWP (Gross World Product) to store that year's data on
            Amazon S3.
            </p>
            <p>
            So we need to decide what to keep. And we need ways of thinking
            about what to keep.

            As we've seen the question of how people and machines work
            together to archive the web is certainly has a quantitative
            componenta to it. But our question of how people (archivists)
            ascribe value to web content was also fundamentally qualitative. 
            </p>
            <p>
            We thought about doing surveys, but surveys of the web archiving
            community have been done, which provide general pictures of the
            types of organizations, tools, procedures at a high level. We
            weren't exactly sure what questions to ask on a survey to get
            at this question of appraisal. We were interested in thick 
            descriptions of the appraisal process itself. What factors went 
            into deciding what materials to collect? What tools did they 
            actually use in their work? What did their daily routines look 
            like?
