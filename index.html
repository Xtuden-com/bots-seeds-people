              Igor Strelkov is a self described Russian nationalist, and 
              former colonel in Russian military intelligence, who has 
              been charged by Ukranian authorities with terrorism.  He 
              is currently being sued by the families of 18 passengers 
              on the MH17 because forces under his command are allegedly 
              responsible for shooting it down.

              for 2016. On December 13th there were 103 snapshots just

          RQ: How is appraisal being enacted in web archives?
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>It seemed like an interesting question given this unique
            socio-technical system comprised of bots, software systems,
            algorithms, archivists, and organizations. And one that has a 
            lot of CSCW shape to it.</p>

            We had started with two additional research questions but 
            realized during the review process that we really only 
            adequately answer this one.
            <ul>
              <li>How do technologies for web crawling and harvesting–seed lists and scopes–figure in their appraisal decisions?</li>
              <li>Are there opportunities to design more useful sys- tems for the appraisal of content for Web archives?</li>

            Our most important and intellectually demanding task as 
            archivists is to make an informed selection of information
            that will provide the future with a representative record
            of human experience in our time. But why must we do it so
            badly? Is there any other field of information gathering
            that has such a broad mandate with a selection process so
            random, so fragmented, so uncoordinated, and even so often
            accidental?

            As we've seen the question of how people and machines work
            together to archive the web is certainly has a quantitative
            componenta to it. But our question of how people (archivists)
            ascribe value to web content was also fundamentally qualitative. 
            </p>
            <p>
            We thought about doing surveys, but surveys of the web archiving
            community have been done, which provide general pictures of the
            types of organizations, tools, procedures at a high level. We
            weren't exactly sure what questions to ask on a survey to get
            at this question of appraisal. We were interested in thick 
            descriptions of the appraisal process itself. What factors went 
            into deciding what materials to collect? What tools did they 
            actually use in their work? What did their daily routines look 
            like?

            The documentary heritage should be formed according to an 
            archival conception, historically assessed, which reflects 
            the <b>consciousness</b> of the particular period for which the
